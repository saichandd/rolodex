# Rolodex

A Rolodex is a rotating file device used to store business contact information. This was one of the first computer programmes massively used to store such information on their systems.

In this project I reworked with an old rolodex programme which was coded in K&R C(this programme was posted to Usenet in 1986) into C99 along with fixing all the memory leaks.
